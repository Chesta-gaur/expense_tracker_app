🧾 Detailed Description

The Expense Tracker App is developed as a practical front-end project aimed at improving budget awareness through a clean, data-driven interface.

The homepage displays three core sections:

Balance Overview: Shows the total remaining balance calculated in real-time.

Transaction History: Lists each entry (income or expense) with visual cues for better differentiation.

Add New Transaction Form: Allows users to input transaction titles and amounts, automatically updating the data set and recalculating totals.

All data entries are saved using the browser’s local storage, ensuring user data remains intact after page refresh.
Users can also delete transactions individually, updating the calculations dynamically.

The design follows a mobile-first responsive layout, adapting seamlessly across all screen sizes. Smooth animations and transitions make the user experience more engaging, while the minimalist design ensures focus remains on the data.
